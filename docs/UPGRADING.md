# Updates and the first image-based installation

Use `https://github.com/metalogico/soloinventory/archive/COMMIT.tar.gz` for a source archive matching a pinned image, replacing COMMIT with the full published main commit SHA.

## Before every update

1. Review the target main commit and migration requirements. Retain the current version/image digest and installation files.
2. Use external tooling to create and verify a coherent recovery copy with all writers stopped. Include `.env`, application data and any private TLS state, and retain the copy off the host.
3. Download the source archive for the target main commit into a **separate directory**. Compare its Compose and example environment with your deployed configuration. Copy approved configuration changes into the existing installation directory; keep your private `.env` and existing override files.
4. Set `SOLOINVENTORY_IMAGE=ghcr.io/metalogico/soloinventory:sha-COMMIT` in your existing `.env`, replacing COMMIT with the full published main commit SHA. `latest` is also supported, but a pinned commit gives you control over updates. Review new environment variables individually.

Use the same `-p`, `--env-file` and `-f` options on **every** command when your deployment uses them. The abbreviated commands below assume the default files and project name.

```sh
docker compose config --quiet
docker compose pull
docker compose stop
docker compose up -d --wait
docker compose ps
```

Pull before stopping to reduce downtime. If the pull fails, the running version remains available. If startup or a migration fails, stop the stack and inspect this stack's logs; do not restart background services against a failed migration. Successful health checks should be followed by sign-in, checking existing records/files and a small edit/upload.

Stopping/recreating containers preserves persistent storage. **Never run `down -v`, `migrate:fresh`, database resets or volume pruning as part of an update.** Updates do not regenerate credentials, keys or the CA.

## Existing source-built installations: first transition to published images

Changing the image is safe only when it uses the same storage and a compatible schema. Older development revisions could change migrations in place. The first release does not infer or repair every historical development schema.

- Record the current Compose project name from container labels, actual volume names and bind mount paths, numeric UID/GID, environment file and override files. `docker compose ps` and `docker inspect <container>` help inspect the installation; avoid sharing their secret-bearing output.
- Compare the deployed database schema and migration history with the v1 baseline using an **isolated copy** of verified recovery data. Run the candidate image in a separate project with copied data, separate ports and bind directories. Confirm existing records and files, authentication and migrations. A production mount must never be used for this rehearsal.
- If the old schema differs, prepare and test a specific incremental migration/import before updating the real stack. Do not delete rows from Laravel's migrations table or reset SQLite's schema version to force startup.
- Keep the real `.env`, `APP_KEY` where applicable, login values, API credentials and HTTPS CA. Replace only the old local image reference with the GHCR reference. Remove any source-build override from the production command or `COMPOSE_FILE`.
- Preserve all existing data mounts and the exact Compose project name. A different name selects new empty volumes; that does not mean the original data was erased.
- Perform the regular update above only after the rehearsal succeeds. Retain the old image and recovery data until the new installation is verified.

The local smoke script tests a fresh image-only install and persistence across container recreation. GitHub Actions does not run these tests. It does not inspect or migrate a particular home server's historical database.

## Rollback

After a schema migration, switching back to an older image alone may be unsafe. Stop all writers, recover the matching pre-update database, photos and configuration through your external tooling, and select the previous pinned image tag or digest. Rehearse recovery in an isolated project first. Keep the same application key and CA.
